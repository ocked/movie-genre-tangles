# movie-genre-tangles
Additional code to https://github.com/tangle-software/tangles needed for analysis of movie genres as tangles, especaially in my [bachelor thesis](link).
To reproduce the results and graphics of the thesis do the following:
1. Download the underlying data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and save it to /data.
2. set up and activate the tangles-dev environment as explained [here](https://github.com/tangle-software/tangles/blob/main/README.md)
3. run 'pip install .'
4. run the notebooks in /scripts_notebooks resp. run 'python_file.py' from(!) ./scripts_notebooks .
